***pi bonds are succeptable to breaking***

The double bond breaks and the bromine is attached on either sides.

OBSERVATION => Red colour of Br2CCl4 gets discharged

MECHANISM
=========

CH2=CH2

Bromine Structure
=================
  δ+   δ-
Br   Br

Due to presence of the pi bond a partial polarity is induced in Br => partial polar molecule

Br-CH2-CH2-Br => 1,2 dibromoetane => Electrophilic addition => Br Participates in the reaction first (mainly) therefore this type of reaction is called electrophilic addition => Anti addition
